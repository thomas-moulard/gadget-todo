TODO list. You will have to four columns:
 * *Activity*: this column contains the title of each item.
 * *Finish*: the current state (in percent) of each item.
 * *Priority*: the priority (in percent) of each item.
 * *Category*: to which group belongs each item.

After doing that, add an item per row and fill the table.

You can then add the widget to your spreadsheet or to your homepage.
The gadget will be automatically updated when the table is changed.

== iGoogle ==
You must indicate the data source URL for iGoogle.

item can be sent by e-mail or the form can be displayed on a website.

First, click on the "Form" tab. Then, click on "share the form" and choose one
of the two options. The form can either be sent by e-mail or a piece of html can
be copied/paster on any website to integrate the form. The "other actions" button
allow you to stop accepting answers to the form, to access to it directly through
a link or to modify the form.
