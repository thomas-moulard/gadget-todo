= How to use it? =

First, you have to create a spreadsheet that will contain information about your
TODO list. You will have to four columns:
 * *Activity*: this column contains the title of each item.
 * *Finish*: the current state (in percent) of each item.
 * *Priority*: the priority (in percent) of each item.
 * *Category*: to which group belongs each item.

After doing that, add an item per row and fill the table.

You can then add the widget to your spreadsheet or to your homepage.
The gadget will be automatically updated when the table is changed.
